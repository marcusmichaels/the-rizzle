The Rizzle
==========

The Rizzle is an obnixious red light that flashes up during a beautiful light dance with the Philips Hue light... the objective is to stamp it out on whatever bulb it shoes up on (using either a tablet or computer) and get the highest score. Be careful though, he's a slippery bastard.

Mad thanks to @cr3 (follow him on Twitter!) for lending me some of his vast, vast knowledge.

This was created at HACKED.io 2013 for the Philips Hue lights.

Muchos Love,
